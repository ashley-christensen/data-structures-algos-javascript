//Arrays: practice basic which involve brute force, then graudally start solving same with better time complexity with one traversal. Sorting and Searching algos
//LinkedList: Improves logical skills of pointers. Start iwth Linked list then eventually move to double
//////

//Binary Tree: One of the most important topics. Maximum time solving problems here
//Hashmap and Backtracking/Recursion: backbone of DSA = recursion. Be patient, many can be solved in O(1) using hashmap

//Graph: create using adjacency list. Once you can create, move to Depth first Search and then Breadth first search.
//Dynamic Programming: top company interview, especially non CS degree
